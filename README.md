# JetsProject

This is a homework project, looking at using classes and objects to create a fleet of jets.

There is a jet object, that identifies all of the parameters of the Jet class, and for the stretch goal the pilot is included when a new jet is instaniated.
There is also a simple converter for MPH to Mach.


the TestJets class, creates a Menu, and gives you the option to look at all the jets, find the fastest jet, the jet with the longest range, or add a new jet.


The pilot class sets the parameters for each pilot, requiring a name, age and experience.
